## 6.2 Fork
A fork is creating copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows the user to 
freely experiment with the changes without having an affect on the original
version of the project. Mostly Fork is used to either propose new changes or make edits
by fixing a bug in the project. So rather than logging an issue for a bug, user can:\
*Fork a Repository
*Make the fix
*Submit pull request for changes to reflect
A fork differs from clone in a way that there exists a connection between
the original repository and the local copy. Hence, fork can be considered to
be acting as a bridge between the original repository and personal copy
where user can contribute to the project using Pull requests.
Forking a project is a simple task. All you need to do is click on the **Fork** button
in the header of a repository \

Why do we need Fork?
1. User may not have the direct permission to work on the main repository
2. If multiple users clone and work on the main version, then it will be
difficult to manage the branches
