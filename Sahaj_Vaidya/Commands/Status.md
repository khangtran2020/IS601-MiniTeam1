## 6.10 Status
The `git status` command is used to exhibit the state of the
current working directory and the staging area. It allows the user
to see which changes have been staged, which haven't and which files
are not being tracked. But this coomand does not show any information
about the history of commits made.
Usage of this command:\
`git status`\
Makes a list of those files which are staged, unstaged and untracked.\
This is a relatively easy to use and straightforward command which simply
shows you what is going with `git add` and `git commit` commands.
The message shown by status command also includes the instructions
for staging and unstaging various related files.
Using `git status` is a good practise to check the state of the current
repository to avoid making commits which you do not intend to make.
