## 6.12 Master Branch
In Git terminology, "master" is a naming convention used when you create branches.
The default branch name in Git is `master`. Once you start making commits,
you are assigned a `master` branch that points towards the latest commit 
made. \
Every time a commit is made, the `master` branch forwards the pointer
automatically.
